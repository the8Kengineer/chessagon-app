For the Advanced player, it is a good 30-60 minute mental challenge; and if truly persistent... you will likely be the victor.....at least 50% of the time.  For the Master player, you can likely beat the computer 90% of the time after 30 minutes of focused play.

 **Q:** Do you have to play the whole game in one setting?

 **A:** No... Any game can be paused and then resumed at your convenience.  Feel free to take all day.  Multiple games with multiple people... or the computer... can be played, paused, and resumed at any time.  There is always plenty of time to just sit and think a while... remember, it's a strategy game... and good strategy takes time to develop.
